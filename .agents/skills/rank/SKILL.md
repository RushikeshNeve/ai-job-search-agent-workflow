# Triage Scraped Jobs into a Ranked Shortlist

You are batch-scoring the jobs that `$scrape` has collected, so the user can decide where to spend `$apply` effort. `$scrape` finds and dedupes postings; `$apply` evaluates one at a time in depth. `$rank` is the bridge: it scores every new posting against the fit framework and returns a ranked shortlist.

`$rank` produces **triage scores**, not final evaluations. It scores from the posting text and the candidate profile only - no company research, no reviewer agent. `$apply`'s Step 1 evaluation (which adds company research) remains authoritative and always re-runs when the user applies.

Follow these steps **in order**.

---

## Step 0: Parse Input

The text following this skill invocation may contain:

- Nothing → rank all jobs with status `new` in `job_scraper/seen_jobs.json`
- A focus area (e.g. `$rank data science`) → rank only jobs whose title or stored fit-notes match the focus
- `--all` → re-rank every job that has not been applied to, including previously ranked ones (useful after the profile changes)
- `--top <N>` → shortlist size (default 5)

---

## Step 1: Load State

1. Read `job_scraper/seen_jobs.json`. If the file is missing or has no entries, tell the user to run `$scrape` first and stop.
2. Read `job_search_tracker.csv`. Build the exclusion set: any company+role already in the tracker is out of scope regardless of flags - it has been applied to or consciously tracked.
3. Select candidates: entries with status `new` (or all non-applied entries with `--all`), minus the exclusion set, filtered by the focus area if one was given.
4. If no candidates remain, say so ("Nothing new to rank - run $scrape to find fresh postings") and stop.
5. Read the scoring framework and profile **once**:
   - `.claude/skills/job-application-assistant/04-job-evaluation.md`
   - `.claude/skills/job-application-assistant/01-candidate-profile.md`

State how many jobs will be ranked before proceeding.

## Step 2: Batch-Fetch and Score

Batch-score the candidate jobs in parallel. Codex CLI has an experimental `spawn_agents_on_csv` tool built exactly for this: it spawns one worker subagent per CSV row, waits for the whole batch, and exports results to a CSV. Prefer it here.

1. **Build a scratch CSV** of the new jobs with columns `id, url, title, company` (one row per candidate from Step 1; `id` is that job's key in `seen_jobs.json`). Write it to a scratch path, e.g. `job_scraper/.rank_batch.csv`.
2. **Call `spawn_agents_on_csv`** with:
   - `csv_path`: the scratch CSV from above
   - `id_column`: `id`
   - `instruction`: a template embedding the scoring rubric and the row placeholders `{url}`, `{title}`, `{company}`. Compose it from the compact rubric extracted from the files you read in Step 1: the strong/moderate/weak skill match areas, direct/adjacent experience domains, behavioral thrive/drain factors, career goals, deal-breakers, and the location constraints. Do **not** make each worker re-read the profile files - the rubric goes inline in the instruction. Tell each worker to fetch the posting at `{url}` and score **only from actually fetched content**; if the URL is dead, redirects to a listing page, or the posting has expired, the worker marks that job `expired` - it never scores from the title alone and never fabricates posting content. Scope is triage: posting text vs. rubric. **No company research, no salary lookup, no web searches** - that depth belongs to `$apply`.
   - `output_schema`: matching the JSON shape below, one object per row:
     ```json
     {
       "key": "<the job's key in seen_jobs.json>",
       "status": "scored" | "expired",
       "scores": { "technical": 0-100, "experience": 0-100, "behavioral": 0-100, "career": 0-100 },
       "location": "PASS" | "FAIL" | "FLAG",
       "deadline": "YYYY-MM-DD" | null,
       "strengths": ["1-3 bullets, grounded in the posting text"],
       "gaps": ["1-3 bullets, honest"],
       "language": "<posting language>"
     }
     ```
   - `output_csv_path`: a scratch path, e.g. `job_scraper/.rank_results.csv`
3. Wait for the batch to complete, then read back `output_csv_path` and parse each row's JSON output for Step 3.

**Fallback if `spawn_agents_on_csv` is unavailable:** fall back to plain natural-language parallel subagent delegation, the same way `$apply`'s reviewer delegation works: ask Codex to spawn one subagent per batch of ~5 jobs (a single subagent is fine for ≤5 jobs), running concurrently, each given the job list (title, company, URL) and the same rubric inline in its prompt, and returning the same JSON array shape per job. Wait for every subagent to finish before continuing.

Scoring uses the dimension definitions from `04-job-evaluation.md` verbatim. The honesty rule applies to triage too: gaps are stated, never smoothed over, and a posting that is a poor fit gets a low score even if it looks prestigious.

---

## Step 3: Aggregate and Rank

Back in the main context, for each scored job:

1. Compute the overall score with the weighting from `04-job-evaluation.md` (Technical 30%, Experience 25%, Behavioral 15%, Career Alignment 30%; location is unweighted).
2. Map to the framework's verdict bands (Strong Fit 75+, Good Fit 60-74, Moderate Fit 45-59, Weak Fit 30-44, Poor Fit <30).
3. **Location veto:** `FAIL` (e.g. requires relocation) excludes the job from the shortlist no matter the score - list it separately with the reason. `FLAG` (e.g. heavy travel) stays in the ranking but carries a visible ⚠ marker for the user to judge.
4. **Deadline urgency:** a deadline within 7 days gets a 🔥 marker and wins ties. A deadline that has already passed moves the job to `expired`.

Sort by overall score (descending), urgency as tiebreaker.

---

## Step 4: Update State

Update `job_scraper/seen_jobs.json` in place - these fields are additive to the scraper's schema:

- Ranked jobs: set `"status": "ranked"` and add `"rank_score": <overall>`, `"rank_verdict": "<band>"`, `"rank_date": "YYYY-MM-DD"`
- Dead or past-deadline jobs: set `"status": "expired"`

Do not modify `job_search_tracker.csv` - that file records applications, and `$rank` never applies. Re-running `$rank` is idempotent: already-`ranked` jobs are skipped unless `--all` re-scores them.

Delete the scratch files (`job_scraper/.rank_batch.csv` and `job_scraper/.rank_results.csv`) once their contents have been folded into `seen_jobs.json`.

---

## Step 5: Present the Shortlist

```
## Job Ranking - YYYY-MM-DD

Ranked <N> new postings (<X> shortlisted, <Y> below threshold, <Z> expired/vetoed).

### Shortlist

| # | Score | Verdict | Title | Company | Location | Deadline | |
|---|-------|---------|-------|---------|----------|----------|---|
| 1 | 78 | Strong Fit | ... | ... | ... | ... | 🔥 |

### Why these ranked highest
**1. <Title> at <Company> (78)** - [2-3 strength bullets and the honest gap, from the worker's findings]
[repeat for each shortlisted job]

### Below threshold
| Score | Verdict | Title | Company | One-line reason |

### Excluded
- <Title> at <Company> - location FAIL: requires relocation
- <Title> at <Company> - expired <date>
```

Rules for the presentation:

- Every claim traces to fetched posting text or the profile - no invented details.
- Say explicitly that these are **triage scores from the posting text only**, and that `$apply` will re-evaluate with company research before anything is drafted.
- Then ask: "Want to apply to any of these? Give me the number(s) and I'll start with the full `$apply` workflow."
- If the user picks one, run the `$apply` workflow on that job's URL, passing the triage verdict as prior context but **re-running the full Step 1 evaluation** - triage never substitutes for it.

---

## Important Rules

1. **Never rank unfetched postings.** A job whose posting cannot be retrieved is marked expired, not guessed at.
2. **Triage depth only.** No company research, no salary lookups, no reviewer agents - `$rank` exists to be cheap enough to run on every scrape batch.
3. **Deal-breakers veto scores.** A 90-point job that fails a location deal-breaker is excluded, not ranked first.
4. **Honest scoring.** Gaps are reported per job; a low-scoring posting is presented as such. The score bands and weights come from `04-job-evaluation.md` - if the user disagrees with a ranking, the fix is updating their profile or the framework, not bending scores.
5. **State stays consistent.** `seen_jobs.json` fields are only added, never restructured, so `$scrape`'s dedup keeps working; the tracker is read-only for this skill.
